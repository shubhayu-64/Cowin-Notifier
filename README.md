# Cowin-Notifier

This is a python script that tweets available slots on the Cowin website.

The Twitter handle of the Bot: [@CowinNotifier](https://twitter.com/CowinNotifier)

## Features

- Find any open slots in any district and tweet important information.
- Runs 24/7 and updates at an interval of 12 hours.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo or download manually.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shubhayu-64/Cowin-Notifier.git
```

2. Move to cloned/downloaded directory ` cd Cowin-Notifier`
3. Run `pip install requirements.txt`
4. Update `config.py` with your Twitter API credentials.
5. Start the script by `python main.py`

## Deploying

Since Cowin APIs are Geo-fenced, it might be difficult to get responses if hosted somewhere else.

I have hosted in my Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ with my local network. This solved the issue for me.
